 * the completion of the original action nor to retrieve thrown exceptions. Thus it is recommended
 * to use {@link Action0ToAction0Async} adapter instead to achieve a similar result.
 * 
 * All asynchronous calls are executed in another thread and forwarded to the
 * {@link Action0#start()} method.
 * 
 * The {@link Executor} to use for the asynchronous invocations can be chosen during creation of
 * this adapter. If no explicit executor is given the a default executor is used. The default
 * executor can be set using the {@link AsyncExecutor#setDefaultExecutor(Executor)} property or is
 * created automatically by the {@link AsyncExecutor}.
